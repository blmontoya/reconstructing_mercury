## Introduction:

The recent rise of neural networks in image reconstruction has allowed researchers to contextualize noisy data and technical artifacts. Yet, despite the growing use of deep learning as a robust tool for scientific analyses, its use in planetary science research remains scarce. This project aims to explore various image reconstruction techniques on the planetary data of Mercury. Planetary data on Mercury’s southern hemisphere is low quality due to the near-polar eccentric orbit of the MESSENGER (Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging) satellite. By exploring how convolutional neural networks can provide reconstructed models of Mercury’s southern hemisphere, researchers can better understand how to apply convolutional neural networks to observe other planetary bodies. This project proposes that by using examples of topographic maps and gravitational fields from other celestial bodies, such as the moon, Mercury’s raw data collected by MESSENGER in the southern hemisphere can be reconstructed.

This research extends beyond the scope of planetary science as well: fields such as archeology require more research into image reconstruction techniques to better understand how worn ancient texts would have looked and what message they would contain. Medical image reconstruction allows clinicians to better diagnose and treat diseases, converting raw data into images that can expose internal structures and shed light on biochemical functions. Similar to how it is crucial to look at the raw data and low degree spherical harmonics for Mercury’s image reconstruction, these fields require more than enhancing an image because they incorporate more factors beyond just the information on screen. Archeology requires knowing how an ancient artifact degraded over time and medical image reconstruction of proteins is helped by knowing how proteins could fold and interact with itself.
